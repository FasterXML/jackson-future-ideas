# Jackson: Future Ideas

This repository exists for sole purpose of having an issue tracker that:

* IS for proposing new modules, related new development, that does not belong under any specific component
* IS NOT for bug reports. Of anything.

But more specifically, right now -- late 2024 -- we have one main goal: get Jackson 3.0.0 ready.
This means:

* Working towards the First Release Candidate: 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT
    * Defining things that we want to have within 3.0.0
    * Deciding on things where we have alternative choices
    * Tracking implementation of thing we want implemented

Note that we do NOT track actual progres using issues here (issues are more for general future ideas), but instead use [Discussions](../../discussions).

Specifically, the ultimate starting point is [Path to Jackson 3.0.0](../../discussions/72).
If unsure where to start, go there.
